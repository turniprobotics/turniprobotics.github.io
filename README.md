# turniprobotics.github.io
This is the source code for the Turnip Robotics project

We're Andrew, Christian and Harry from St Patrick's College Sutherland, and this is our Robotics project for our IST class

Our mission is to create a robot that can traverse through the obstacle courses that the other groups make (including our own) the fastest. We are probably going to base our design off TARS, from the movie Interstellar, unless this design proves completely unfeasable in which case we will change to something else.

We will be using the LEGO MINDSTORM NXT Robot, so if you want to make a copy of our robot to try for yourself, make sure its the NXT. Our code probably won't work with the EV3 or RCX, but if you want to try port it to those platforms, by all means go ahead! If the port is good enough, we may even link to your robot on our website!

## How to use this repository

If you want to copy our robot and/or terrain, the LEGO Designer and LEGO .rbt files for the MINDSTORMS NXT program are in the Robot/ folder.

If you want to copy our website (for making a website for your own robot, for example), the code for that is in this repositiory, as we are using GitHub Pages to host the website.

Regardless of what you do with the code, just make sure you reference us (we don't mind if you reference Turnip Robotics or our names: Andrew, Christian and Harry. Both would be nice though). And if your robot breaks, we're not liable. That's all part of the MIT license I'm sure you've read ;)
